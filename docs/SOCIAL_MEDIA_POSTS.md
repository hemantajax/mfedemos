🚀 Building Scalable Applications with Micro-Frontends

After working extensively with micro-frontend architecture, I've documented a practical, hands-on guide that covers everything from local development to production deployment.

📦 What's inside:
• Creating Host (Shell) applications
• Building independent Remote micro-frontends
• Sharing services & state across micro-frontends
• Local vs Production configuration strategies
• Real-world examples with Angular 20 & Module Federation

The architecture allows teams to:
✅ Work independently without conflicts
✅ Deploy features separately
✅ Scale teams and codebase efficiently
✅ Use different tech stacks when needed
✅ Maintain smaller, focused codebases

I've included actual code examples, architecture diagrams, and links to a live demo with 8+ micro-frontends running in production.

Whether you're considering micro-frontends or already implementing them, this guide provides practical insights you can apply immediately.
