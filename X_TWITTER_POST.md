**Tweet 2:**

```
1/ The Architecture 🏗️

• Host app (Shell) orchestrates everything
• Products & Cart as independent micro-frontends
• Each deployable separately
• Runtime integration via Module Federation

No build-time coupling = True independence!
```

**Tweet 3:**

```
2/ Tech Stack ⚡

• Angular 18 (zoneless!)
• Nx Monorepo
• Module Federation
• Bootstrap 5
• GitHub Actions CI/CD

All deployed automatically to GitHub Pages
```

**Tweet 4:**

```
3/ The Game Changer 🎯

Removed Zone.js for zoneless change detection:
✅ 47KB lighter
✅ Faster runtime
✅ More control

This is Angular's future!
```

**Tweet 5:**

```
4/ Shared Libraries 📦

Organized into 9 specialized libs:
• Layout (eager)
• UI Components (lazy)
• Services
• Pipes/Directives
• Utils
• Styles

Type-safe imports with @nxmfe/* paths!
```

**Tweet 6:**

```
5/ Deployment Magic 🚀

GitHub Actions automatically:
1. Lints all code
2. Runs tests
3. Builds for production
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

Every. Single. Push.

Zero manual work!
```

**Tweet 7:**

```
6/ Results 📊

Bundle sizes (gzipped):
• Host: ~180KB
• Products: ~45KB
• Cart: ~42KB

Lighthouse: 95+ across the board

That's what proper architecture gives you!
